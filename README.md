# Etch-A-Sketch
Create pixel pictures by coloring in squares that your mouse touches. Follows the basic rules of an etch-a-sketch where drawings form by anywhere the cursor goes. Retracing paths to draw details in another section of the canvas is a must. This web version adds a modern twist allowing for artists to change the color they are drawing with and resize the canvas. Resizing the canvas erases the entire canvas.
